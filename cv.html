<p class="blackbg">Computer Science became my passion when we started programming in C in second grade of high school. The feeling of success and fulfilment when my first program worked was unforgettable.
 By the time I was in third grade we started more serious programming in C++, and in 4th grade C#.
 I was placed third overall in the exam organised by the Centre of Excellence for Computer Science (the government's program for gifted students) in 2017 and chose to attend the Java course which lasted 4 hours a week throughout 16 weeks.

<p class="blackbg">
  I enjoy doing presentations and volunteer to make them whenever the opportunity arises. Also, I love public speaking. I believe sharing my ideas and thoughts with others is a good way to improve myself and my work,
  learn more and gain valuable feedback on the matter. Different views and processes of thinking is what I cherish when it comes to computing - there are as many ways to reach a solution as there are programmers trying to solve it.
  <br><br>I have been a member of the World Organisation of the Scout Movement for the last 11 years. Being a scout is a great passion of mine; it has taught me the importance of acceptance of other peopleâ€™s ideas, opinions and attitudes and,
  most of all, how to function as a part of a team. These experiences have helped me gain an invaluable sense of responsibility, leadership and communication skills.
  <br><br>For these reasons, I love working in teams and contribute to team projects as much as I can.
